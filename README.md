🔭 As a Data Scientist, I have spent the past two years honing my skills in managing Machine Learning algorithms, ETL processes, task automation, and programming-based problem solving. My primary programming language is Python, but I also have experience with R, Matlab, and Fortran, among others.

⚡️ My passion lies in clean energy and my goal is to play a role in the transition towards a more sustainable energy matrix through renewable technologies and related projects. I have also put this passion into action by volunteering for uno.cinco in the green energies department, where I was able to gain hands-on experience and contribute to initiatives promoting sustainability. I aim to continue making a positive impact on the world and contributing to a brighter, more sustainable future.
